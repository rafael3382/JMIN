# JMIN
(It's still not working! I just made the base, nothing else.)
A compiled and interpreted language (you choose), 
JMIN(name may vary, I just used random letters) It is a language designed for a graphical interface, highly customizable, and simple
It will probably be faster than even c++ sometimes, Using optimizers
But JMIN can make CLI apps too, 

# Plataforms
JMIN Can be compiled to Android, iOS, Windows, Linux and MacOS
